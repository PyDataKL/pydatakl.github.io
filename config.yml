          PyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 
          non-profit organization in the United States. PyData 
          provides a forum for the international community of users
          and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas
          and learn from each other. The global PyData network 
          promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, 
          and emerging technologies for data management, processing, 
          analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach 
          data science using many languages, including (but not 
          limited to) Python, Julia, and R.
