This article features Senior Lead Data Scientist, Laleh Asadzadeh. Enjoy!\nThe speaker   Laleh received her MSc. in Computer Science in 2016 from Southern Illinois University. Her research focused on the modelling and analysis of social network users’ activities. Laleh then was a data scientist at Potentia Analytics Inc. and was in charge of developing and implementing several research projects that enhance the quality of service in hospitals. Before that, she received her MSc. in Mathematics in 2001 from Sharif University of Technology. Her Masters thesis was on defining sets in combinatorial structures and their applications in cryptography. After graduation, Laleh was a Mathematics instructor, researcher, and research mentor at Isfahan Mathematics House. She specializes in Mathematical Modelling, Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, and programming languages, such as Python and R.\nDay-to-day Q: What makes you excited to come to work?\nA: Helping trainees to learn about data science and to build a brighter future for themselves, and their country is wonderful!\nWhat’s your daily routine like?\nMost of the time, I spend the whole day in class. Sometimes, I need to research about new concepts, share them with the team, and update our training material or create new courses based on the market demand.\nWhat are the differences in the job scope and requirements between data scientist and data analyst?\nGenerally, solid knowledge in machine learning is a MUST for data scientists, however for data analysts it might be optional in some cases. Data analysts, though, need to have a good understanding of statistics, database, and data visualization.\nDoes your work require you to research new models or just use available models for data analysis?\nWe research market demand and new data science models/concepts/tools.\nHow to find data analyst projects outside of your fulltime job?\nHow do you keep yourself up-to-date with all the new innovations in the Data Science industry while working full time?\nMost of the time our work requires us to stay up-to-date, because we need to make sure our solutions are the best possible solutions considering various constraints. I may not have time to spend doing projects outside working hours, but reading others' solutions is interesting.\nI usually check:\n Machine Learning Mastery: https://machinelearningmastery.com, Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com, KDNuggets: https://www.kdnuggets.com, Towards Data Science: https://towardsdatascience.com, Stanford online course: https://online.stanford.edu/  When I was a fresh graduate, YouTube and Coursera were my close friends.\nMost ot the time our work requires us to stay up-to-date, because we need to make sure our solutions are the best possible solutions considering various constraints.\nWhat are the tools/software used for data analysis in the industry?\nExcel, SAS, Power BI, Tableau, Python, R. Some of them are not useful if you need live analysis/visualizations.\nHow to get into Data Science When contemplating a potential career switch to data science, which of the two is more important: a formal qualification or practical experience such as side projects?\nBoth of them are important, but practical experience has special value if it reflects how self-driven \u0026 team-oriented you are.\nDo I need a data science certificate to work in the field?\nIt depends on your resume. If you had the chance to do relevant projects, even as your hobby, having a certificate may not be important. However, if your background in certain high-demand skills is not that strong or you don’t have proof of knowledge (such as personal projects and practical experience), having a certificate may help you.\nWhat are the do’s and don’ts for beginners?\nInstead of being a perfectionist, set up a feasible plan and follow that, because becoming a data scientist is a long journey that needs patience and hard work. Don’t think you need to be perfect before looking for job opportunities or starting projects. Your plan needs to include both learning and practice steps. So, after learning for a while, do a small project and publish that on your Kaggle or GitHub profile. Don’t be afraid of applying for jobs that match 80% of your resume. Get prepared for job interviews, study interview questions in depth, but don’t get disappointed if you fail job interviews. Learn from them and build your knowledge. At the end of the day, you need ONE good job and it may come after many failures.\nWhat will you recommend for those with zero knowledge for this topic to start their own reading/ first step etc.\nFirst, read about various job titles and positions in data science. Choose the one that is closer to your interest and background. Understand key skills for your desired role, plan to master them and do small projects while learning.\nWhen you feel you are ready enough (not necessarily perfect) apply for jobs. Look for a good manager and good team in a good company. For your first job, salary does not matter at all.\nSome skills are a MUST:\n SQL for database; One of: Python, R, Excel, Tableau, Power BI; and basic statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, outliers, distributions) for data analysis.  On top of this skillset, based on your desired role as data scientist/data engineer/data analyst/data visualizer, you need other advanced knowledge/tools in machine learning, statistics, database, programming languages, or visualization.\nWhat do you think the most important skill/value that we need to prepare ourselves with before venturing into this field?\nProblem solving.\nI am a fresh graduate looking for an opportunity. How should I stand out from other candidates? Should I pay more attention in resume, networking, or other aspects?\n Read the job description and make sure the first page of your resume clearly shows your relevant knowledge/experience. As a student, you may have done assignments/projects relevant to the job description. Don’t be shy to mention these in your resume. For these projects, clearly mention the problem, your solution, and the outcome. It’s even better if it has been a team project. In that case, make sure you mention team work in your resume and highlight your role and responsibilities. Never lie on your resume, unless there is ONE key skill you have working knowledge of and you can learn it quickly, in case you get the job. Also, you need to make sure you can answer interview questions. About your skillset, beside mentioning each skill, mention your knowledge level as well, for example:  Advanced: Excel, Tableau; Intermediate: Python, SQL    What programming language would you recommend to learn and how do I start?\nSQL is a must for fetching data from database and doing some basic data analysis. Between R and Python, you can choose based on your desired role. Some people prefer Python for development, some prefer R for research; however, personally I cannot say which one you should learn. Currently, I use Python at work but I did my masters' thesis in R and I found both of them useful with specific pros and cons. To start, you can watch YouTube videos and take some online courses.\nWhat to pay attention to when reading data analyst or data scientist job descriptions?\nFirst, look at the industry. If you like the role, check the responsibilities and required skills. Google the company reviews and learn about their working environment, interview process and so on. Check the company’s page and their data science team profiles on LinkedIn. Check for how long data science team members have been there.\nCan a Master’s graduate work as data science manager even without experience?\nI believe a manager needs to have leadership experience as part of her/his work experience.\nTechnical questions How to apply data science in the recruitment industry?\nThis article: https://blog.recruitee.com/analytics-in-recruitment/ includes some questions related to recruitment that can be answered by data analysis:\n Candidate sources: which are your most effective sourcing platforms (job boards, social media, referrals, and so on). Candidate screening: how long the process takes, which candidate screening techniques are effective, and which aren’t. Lead times: how long it takes to go from application to offer and what effect that has on drop off rates. Future employment needs: what positions are likely to be needed or become vacant in the future and what will the hiring manager’s needs be. Future employee performance: how likely a candidate or new hire is to perform well on the job. Retention rates: how long a new hire will stay will the company or how likely it is that other candidates will leave. Hiring bottlenecks: where roadblocks in the hiring process regularly occur, what their impact is, and how to fix them. Urgency of hiring: which roles and skills are needed most urgently to meet company needs.  Future trends How is the job market outlook for Data Engineers, Data Analysts and Data Scientists in Malaysia?\nHOT 🔥\nWill there be a shortage of demands as more and more people jump into this industry?\nI believe the demand will stay high, because the more questions we can answer using data analysis, the more new areas will show interest. Data science still has lots of potential for applications in manufacturing, healthcare, education, and transportation.\nIs data analytics just hype? How you see it in the next 10-20 years?\nCurrently, we have Data Science as a major at universities. I believe data science (tools and concepts) will be part of the curriculum at least at high school or even in primary school as nowadays there are Python/R workshops for kids.\n Connect with Laleh on LinkedIn.\nIf you missed our webinar, you may catch a replay on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5w1BkGBSVs\n","wordCount":"1584","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-11-29T11:48:14+08:00","dateModified":"2020-11-29T11:48:14+08:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://pydatakl.github.io/posts/speaker-spotlight_laleh-asadzadeh/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"kualalumpur.py","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://pydatakl.github.io/assets/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-EFVRP3XXMD"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
