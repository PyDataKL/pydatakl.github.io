### Day-to-day

**Q: What makes you excited to come to work?**

A: My colleagues. I have an amazing team, and working with them is an absolute pleasure.

**What's your daily routine like?**

I average anywhere between 2-4 hours a day in meetings (gathering user requirements for project specification, aligning on modeling decisions, updating stakeholders on development progress, relaying results of analysis, etc.) due to the sheer number of projects I'm involved with. Hours are flexible, but they're usually spread throughout the day as some of my projects involve colleagues from different time zones. Related tasks such as data cleaning, model development, ad-hoc analysis etc. is spread out throughout the day between meetings. Depending on the scale of the project (and resource availability) I may or may not have assistance from the team, so proper time management is critical to preventing work from spilling over to weekends. With current work from home arrangements, I start at about 8-9am, finish at about 6pm, and if necessary work a little bit after dinner.

**What are the differences in the job scope and requirements between data scientist and data analyst?**

This varies greatly from one organization to another, but where I work data analysts are model users, whereas data scientists are model developers. The analyst works more closely with the business, is capable of interpreting the model's results, and performs additional analysis to support business needs. I often work closely with them during model development as they have a good understanding of the business, but with the added edge of being well-versed with the data.

**Does your work require you to research new models or just use available models for data analysis?**

Both. Wherever possible, try not to reinvent the wheel. There have however been cases where we needed something custom for a niche application. If I had to give you a ballpark figure, 9 out of 10 projects would suffice with off the shelf techniques.

**How to find data analyst projects outside of your fulltime job?**

I don't. I'm honestly so bogged down with work that I no longer work on projects outside the office. More than happy to spend time with my wife and kid now. :)

**How do you keep yourself up-to-date with all the new innovations in the Data Science industry while working full time?**

I use Reddit to aggregate reading material, and Twitter to engage in conversations with the data community. I've tried local Facebook groups before, but I've found that some of them can be quite hostile.

**What are the tools/software used for data analysis in the industry?**

Excel/Python/R/SAS/Tableau.


### How to get into Data Science

**When contemplating a potential career switch to data science, which of the two is more important: obtaining a formal qualification or practical experience such as side projects?"**

Arguably practical experience matters more, but hiring managers wouldn't be able to assess this unless you have some tangible output that serves as a performance indicator such as a published project. Formal qualifications are basically "outsourcing" the assurance that a candidate has been trained in specific tasks related to the field.

**Do I need a data science certificate to work in the field?**

No.

**What are the do(s) and don't(s) for beginners?**

There are plenty of do's and don'ts, but IMHO these are the big ones:
- Do: When engaging with your model user, talk less and listen more. Design with them in mind. A model is useless if nobody wants to use it.
- Don't: Overcomplicate things. I'm a firm believer in [Occam's razor](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) - go with simpler solutions wherever possible.

**What will you recommend for those with zero knowledge for this topic to start their own reading/ first step etc.**

- Statistics: [Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElrath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/).
- Vizualization: Storytelling with Data by Cole Knaflic.
- Python: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart.
- General programming: Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup.
- General consulting:  The McKinsey Mind by Ethan Rasiel & Paul Friga.
- Machine Learning: Hands-On Machine Learning by Aurelien Geron.

**What do you think the most important skill/value that we need to prepare ourselves with before venturing into this field?**

Critical thinking. Evaluate each process, e.g. where your data coming from, how it's collected, etc.

**I am a fresh graduate looking for an opportunity. How should I stand out from other candidates? Should I pay more attention in resume, networking, or other aspects?**

Keep your resume simple. Put thought into how you can best utilize the limited space on a resume. Fancy != informative. One mistake I've made in the past is use scales to indicate proficiency, e.g. 7/10 in Python. Ask yourself - what qualifies as a 7/10? Can this even be measured, and if it can, is one person's interpretation of a 7 consistent with another's? Networking is critical, reach out to professionals at conferences and on social media. Remember to interact well, don't just ask for a position outright with no introduction.

**What programming language would you recommend and how do I start?**

Python due to the sheer number of data-related job adverts listing it as a requirement. Nevertheless, be prepared to reskill or pick up another language - we use the best tool for the job. For example, when it comes to time series I rather work with R, for Bayesian sampling I'd use C.

**What to pay attention to when reading data analyst/ data scientist job description when applying the job?**

Scope of responsibilities and requirements - if they're too wide, the company doesn't know what they want. This is a big red flag.

**Can a Master degree graduate work as data science manager even without experience?**

As the name suggests, a data science manager must be able to manage data scientists - this means stakeholder interaction, project management, task prioritization, and resource management. Technical guidance is usually left to your lead data scientist. If your Masters provides you experience in these aspects, then I don't see why not. Otherwise, it's a hard no. I've seen highly technical folk (some even with PhDs) who utterly fail as managers because they can't deliver on the aforementioned items.

### Technical questions

**How to apply data science in recruitment industry?**

I would advise talking to a recruitment specialist to understand their pain points, then working backwards to see if the required data is availlable to address their concerns.

**How do you tread the ethical line in a field that can have equal positive and negative consequences to society? For example, how much profiling/generalization in machine learning models is too much and what kind of regulations can be put in place to ensure human intervention will always be required in the future?**

From data collection and retention policies to model specifications and fairness, it's important to have guard rails and bake them in every step of the way. These guard rails can be in the form of requirements for data preparation to ensure models aren't trained on biased samples to full-blown governance processes encompassing the entire data science workflow a company uses. The level of how ingrained the governance is should commensurate with the human impact of the output.

**How do you make use of data science tools for Covid 19 situation?**

Depends on what you want to do. For example, most banks I know were already running scenario-based simulations such as estimating the impact of a viral outbreak such as COVID on specific industries as far back as 2002.

### Future trends

**How is job market for Data Engineer, Data Analyst and Data Scientist in Malaysia?**

Currently still booming. One plus point is I now see job descriptions that are more specific, indicating that companies now have a better idea on what they're looking for.

**From your perspective, what will be the demand for data scientists in 5 years from now?**

I believe that the role of a dedicated data scientist will fade in favor of citizen data scientists as tools become more accessible. I have personally seen how models built using automated machine learning tools by the right business user can outperform any model coded from scratch by a data scientist.

**Will there be a shortage of demands as more and more people jump into this industry?**

There will always be a demand for good talent. Expect the bar to move up as companies have more candidates to choose from. Personally, I place a lot of emphasis on a candidate's thought process when hiring. Data science is first and foremost about systematic problem solving.

**Is it this data analytics just a hype or how you see it in next 10-20 years?**

My expectation is that moving forward, all roles will entail some degree of data literacy.
