### Day-to-day

**Q: What makes you excited to come to work?**

Helping trainees to learn about data science and to build brighter future for themselves and their country is wonderful.

**What's your daily routine like?**

Most of the time, I spend the whole day in class. Sometimes, I need to research about the new concepts, share them with the team, and update our training material or create new courses based on the market demand. 

**What are the differences in the job scope and requirements between data scientist and data analyst?**

Generally, solid knowledge in machine learning is a MUST for data scientists, however for data analysts it might be optional in some cases. Data analysts, though, need to have a good understanding of statistics, database, and data visualization.

**Does your work require you to research new models or just use available models for data analysis?**

We research market demand and new data science models/concepts/tools. 

**How to find data analyst projects outside of your fulltime job?**

**How do you keep yourself up-to-date with all the new innovations in the Data Science industry while working full time?**

I usually study 
- Machine Learning Mastery: https://machinelearningmastery.com,
- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com, 
- KDNuggets: https://www.kdnuggets.com, and 
- Towards Data Science: https://towardsdatascience.com. 

I may not have time to spend doing those projects but reading about others' solutions is interesting. 

Most ot the time our work enforce us to stay up-to-date, because we need to make sure our solutions are the best possible solutions considering various constraints. 

**What are the tools/software used for data analysis in the industry?**

Excel, SAS, Power BI, Tableau, Python, R. Some of them are not useful if you need live analysis/visualizations.

### How to get into Data Science

**When contemplating a potential career switch to data science, which of the two is more important: a formal qualification or practical experience such as side projects?**

Both of them are important, but practical experience is important specially if it reflects how self-driven & team-player you are. 

**Do I need a data science certificate to work in the field?**

It depends on your resume. If you had the chance to do relevant projects even as your hobby, having a certificate may not be important. However, if your background in certain high-demand skills is not that strong or you don't have proof of knowledge (e.g. personal projects, practical experience), certificate may help you.

**What are the do's and don'ts for beginners?**

Instead of being perfectionist, set up a feasible plan and follow that because it is a long journey that needs patience and hard work with a reasonable reward. Don't wait unil you are perfect and then look for job opportunities or start projects. Your plan needs to include both learning and practice steps. Don't be afraid of applying for jobs that match 80% your resume. Get prepared for job interviews, study interview questions in depth, but don't get disappointed if you fail job interviews. Learn from them, and build your knowledge. At the end of the day, you need ONE good job and it may come after many failures.  

**What will you recommend for those with zero knowledge for this topic to start their own reading/ first step etc.**

First, read about various job titles and positions in data science. Choose the one that is closer to your interest and background. Understand key skills for your desired role, plan to master them and do small projects while learning. 

When you feel you are ready enough (not necessary perfect) apply for jobs. Look for a good manager and good team in a good company. For your first job, salary does not matter at all. 

Some skills are a MUST: [SQL for database]+[Python or R or Excel or Tableau or Power BI + basic statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, outliers, distributions) for data analysis]. On top of this skillset, based on your desired role as data scientist/data engineer/data analyst/data visualizer, you need other advanced knowledge/tools in machine learning, statistics, database, programming languages.

**What do you think the most important skill/value that we need to prepare ourselves with before venturing into this field?**

Problem solving 

**I am a fresh graduate looking for an opportunity. How should I stand out from other candidates? Should I pay more attention in resume, networking, or other aspects?**

- Read the job description and make sure the first page of your resume clearly shows your relevant knowledge/experience. 
- As a student, you may have done assignments/projects relevant to the job description, don't be shy, mention them in your resume. For those projects clearly mention what was the problem, what was your solution, what was the outcome. If it has been a team project, it's even better but make sure you mention that in your resume and write about your role and responsibilities. 
- Never lie on your resume, unless there is ONE key skill you have a working knowledge on that and you can learn it quickly, in case you get the job. 
- About your skillset, beside mentioning each skill, mention your knowledge level as well. For example, Advanced: Excel, Tableau ; Intermediate: Python, SQL 

**What programming language would you recommend to learn and how do I start?**

SQL is a must for fetching data from database and doing some basic data analysis. Between R and Python, based on your desired role you can choose. Some people prefer Python for development, some prefer R for research; however, personally I cannot say which one should be used where. To start you can watch youtube videos and take some online courses. 

**What to pay attention to when reading data analyst or data scientist job descriptions?**

First, look at their industry. If you like it, check the responsibilities and required skills. Google the company reviews and learn about their working environment, interview process etc. Check the company's page and their data science team profiles on LinkedIn. Check for how long data science team members have been there. 

**Can a Master's graduate work as data science manager even without experience?**

I believe a manager needs to have leadership experience as part of her/his work experience

### Technical questions

**How to apply data science in the recruitment industry?**

This article: https://blog.recruitee.com/analytics-in-recruitment/ includes some questions related to recruitment that can be answered by data analysis:
- Candidate sources: which are your most effective sourcing platforms (job boards, social media, referrals, and so on).
- Candidate screening: how long the process takes, which candidate screening techniques are effective, and which aren’t.
- Lead times: how long it takes to go from application to offer and what effect that has on drop off rates.
- Future employment needs: what positions are likely to be needed or become vacant in the future and what will the hiring manager’s needs be.
- Future employee performance: how likely a candidate or new hire is to perform well on the job.
- Retention rates: how long a new hire will stay will the company or how likely it is that other candidates will leave.
- Hiring bottlenecks: where roadblocks in the hiring process regularly occur, what their impact is, and how to fix them.
- Urgency of hiring: which roles and skills are needed most urgently to meet company needs.

### Future trends

**How is the job market outlook for Data Engineers, Data Analysts and Data Scientists in Malaysia?**

HOT

**Will there be a shortage of demands as more and more people jump into this industry?**


I believe the demand will stay high, because the more questions we can answer using data analysis, the more new areas will show interest. Data science in manufacturing, healthcare, education, and transportation has still lots of potential.

**Is data analytics just hype? How you see it in the next 10-20 years?**

Currently, we have Data Science as a major at universities. I believe data science (tools and concepts) will be part of the curriculum at least at high school or even in primary school as nowadays there are Python/R workshops for kids.
